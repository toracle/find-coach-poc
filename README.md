# Proof of Concept of FindCoach service

Use jekyll to build a coach referal site cost effectively.

## Install and test run

First, install ruby.

`gem install jekyll`

Clone this repository and `cd` into.

`jekyll serve`


## Content management

To add a new coach, create a new file into `_coaches/` directory.


## TODO

* Layout overall site
* In coaches page, user can filter coach according to their criteria (cost range, region, domain area) via AJAX. Note [this article](https://alexpearce.me/2012/04/simple-jekyll-searching).
